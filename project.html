		<h1>My Freecode Camp Story</h1>
		<h2>An Intruiging Article</h2>
		<p> Learning to code camp was not an easy one.
		One would say freecode is just about following the instructions given to you and doong what you are expected to do but as  easy as it seems, there is a lot of stress attached.
		To all beginners out there learning to code, I would recommend freecode camp for you. Free code camp is a very educative website and as a matter of fact learning from there is very beneficial
		since you get to enquire about things you do not know about from  the community there and learn so many other things. Learning from free code camp help me gain much knowledge about html and css. 
		it is very educative.Anyway I am Ransford and this is my freecode camp story.Going on day by day along with free code was fun. In fact it is very fun coding on there. I kept forgetting and remembering that i had to learn
		and whole lots but still we passed through. Coding is not something learn to complete as like all regular world languages this computer language is updated all the time. We tend to make new discoveries
		all the time and man has to be on his toes for facts all day long. As at know I'm still on freecode camp and I'm still learning. Also Jazz music is one booster.</p>

		Learning to code camp was not an easy one.
		One would say freecode is just about following the instructions given to you and doong what you are expected to do but as  easy as it seems, there is a lot of stress attached.
		To all beginners out there learning to code, I would recommend freecode camp for you. Free code camp is a very educative website and as a matter of fact learning from there is very beneficial
		since you get to enquire about things you do not know about from  the community there and learn so many other things. Learning from free code camp help me gain much knowledge about html and css. 
		it is very educative.Anyway I am Ransford and this is my freecode camp story.Going on day by day along with free code was fun. In fact it is very fun coding on there. I kept forgetting and remembering that i had to learn
		and whole lots but still we passed through. Coding is not something learn to complete as like all regular world languages this computer language is updated all the time. We tend to make new discoveries
		all the time and man has to be on his toes for facts all day long. As at know I'm still on freecode camp and I'm still learning. Also Jazz music is one booster.
